                <p class="first-p">This page will function as a tutorial for selecting and using color palettes. I might use some different color palettes throughout this page to use as examples. I will explain the importance of picking four to five different yet complementing colors. Explaining the color wheel will be a crucial part of understanding the content of this page and therefore an image will be put about here that will explain it. Through a sound explanation of the color wheel, color theory and its importance to web design will be better understood and appreciated. I will go through and explain the types of ways of coming up with a color palette with examples of each. There will be a section on Monochromatic palettes, which are picking one color to generate a palette and changing the hue and/or saturation of the color to get different colors in order to get a matching palette. Another section will be on Analogous palettes, which are palettes based on three to four colors which allows for greater variety in a color palette while ensuring that the colors won’t clash with each other. A further palette creating formula is to colors that are opposites of each other and changing their hue and saturation to form a palette, creating a Complementary palette that has enough contrast that it keeps the website from becoming dull.</p>

                <p class="sec-p">This page will explain the importance of arranging the elements of a page in a way that allows for easy navigation through a site. I will go through a step by step process explaining how and where to place images and text so that a reader and/or viewer will not get lost and confused. I will also demonstrate how you can place and overlap elements to get “floating” or “hovering” effects. I will also show the importance of properly sizing images and boxes that contain child elements to ensure that the flow and layout of a site doesn’t become confusing and hard to follow.</p>
